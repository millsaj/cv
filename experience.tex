		\bodytext{Appt Health helps the NHS provide preventative healthcare by automating the call and recall process for patients. They have automated SMS and letter invitation channels, a GUI booking tool for staff calling patients over the phone and a small windows application.
		
		As the lead developer at Appt Health since the project's inception, I was responsible for developing and maintaining a software system to handle sensitive patient data and integrate with several NHS APIs. The clinical risk involved required a rigorous approach to all aspects of development and testing.
		
		I led and managed a small team of other developers; doing so was an exciting challenge pushed me to be a better communicator and leader. It was my responsibility to set our software development standards, encourage and train other developers, manage our backlog and sprints, have the final say on large architectural or security decisions and evaluate new technical hires.}
