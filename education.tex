	{MSci Hons Computer Science} {2014 -- 2018}
	{\bodytext{I graduated with a masters in computer science. I particularly enjoyed the modules on embedded systems, operating systems and distributed systems. Most of my programming experience during this time was in C and Java. I also did a placement with a local resilience forum working on a VoIP system, built in C++, that facilitates communication during emergencies such as flooding.
