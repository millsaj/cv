\roottitle{Introduction}

\bodytext{
For 8 years I have been a software developer, working in an office or at home on a computer. Last year I moved to Canmore to facilitate a more active lifestyle and am now looking to be able to work with people face to face and be more part of my local community.

I currently have a two year open work visa and am applying for permanent residency. I live up near Quarry Lake and should easily be able to commute by foot or bike.

I have experience working in and leading teams, working under pressure to a high quality and interacting with business-to-business customers.
